Objective (O): 
I learned how to do unit testing with the mock library and used JPA to retrieve data from the database.
I explored various useful annotations and applied @Entity and @OneToMany annotations in practice.<br>

Reflective (R): 
I found it fun because it was my first time using the mock library. 
I enjoyed learning new annotations and felt a sense of accomplishment in successfully retrieving data.
I also appreciated the simplicity and power of JPA.<br>

Interpretive (I): 
I discovered that the mock library is very useful for unit testing and realized the importance of annotations in JPA.
I understood how mock libraries can simulate other layers effectively and recognized the potential of JPA for efficient database interactions.<br>

Decisional (D):
I plan to continue using the mock library for unit tests and intend to explore more JPA annotations.
I aim to integrate mock library usage into future projects and decide to deepen my understanding of JPA for better database management.<br>
